# project-lifecycle — enumerated-task-list guard (Definition of Done, forcing function 1).
# Satisfied by the CONTENT of a portable checklist artifact (see ART_REL below); a host task
# tool (TaskCreate / TodoWrite) is an optional additional satisfier, never the contract.
# The skill mandates "materialize the steps as a task list — FIRST action on every
# invocation, before any work", but prose alone is model self-discipline — observed
# skipping. This hook moves the rule to platform enforcement.
#
# jq-only: no python3 (the hooks' dependency envelope). Uses jq to read
# session_id / tool_name / payload fields from the PreToolUse stdin JSON; the
# per-session task counter is bash arithmetic on a marker file.
#
# Two entry modes (arg 1):
#   mark  — PreToolUse:TaskCreate|TodoWrite. Counts tasks created this session
#           (TaskCreate = one task per call → increment a counter; TodoWrite =
#           array in one call → take its length). Records "an ENUMERATED task list
#           exists" (marker keyed by session_id) only once the count reaches
#           PLC_TASKLIST_MIN. A single one-task list no longer satisfies the guard.
#           Always exits 0.
#   check — PreToolUse for gated tools. If no enumerated task list exists yet,
#           blocks ONCE (exit 2) with an actionable message carrying a nonce; after
#           that single block it does NOT go silent — it returns permissionDecision
#           `defer` plus an `additionalContext` UNVERIFIED notice on EVERY later gated
#           call, so "could not verify" stays distinct from "verified" in the model's
#           context. Still block-once, never a wall (loop-guard rule), and `defer`
#           leaves the user's normal permission flow untouched.
#           Gated tools: Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit always; Bash only when
#           the command is a `git commit`/`git push` (state-change boundary — the
#           intent-gate's read-only Bash + entry detection pass freely); subagent
#           dispatch (Task|Agent) only when PLC_TASKLIST_GATE_TASK=1 (default off,
#           so the intent-gate's Explore dispatch is not false-blocked).
#
# Per-phase re-arm (PLC_TASKLIST_REARM=1, default on): the block is once per
# PHASE, not once per session. A close-gate run (`make task-done` /
# `make phase-done` / `close-gate.sh`) is the canonical PLC phase-close boundary
# — when check sees one, it wipes this session's markers (seen/count/nudged), so
# the NEXT gated edit re-forces a fresh ≥PLC_TASKLIST_MIN task list for the next
# phase. Maps PLC's own "one task = one list = one gate" model. Loop-safe: re-arm
# fires only AFTER a real close-out, never mid-phase. Set PLC_TASKLIST_REARM=0 to
# revert to once-per-session. Bare-token match (git commit -m "task-done…" keeps
# its quote char after word-split → no false re-arm).
#
# Threshold PLC_TASKLIST_MIN=3: TaskCreate's own guidance is "3+ distinct steps";
# the most-compressed legit cadence still has ≥3 real steps; <3-step work is meant
# to skip the skill entirely.
#
# Fail-open on any parse error / missing session_id. Escape hatch:
# PLC_TASKLIST_GUARD=0 disables. RESUME.md writes are exempt (no deadlock with the
# context-floor hook, which demands a RESUME checkpoint write when it fires).

# The PORTABLE satisfier. The guard used to be satisfied only by a host tool call
# (TaskCreate / TodoWrite). That is unsatisfiable wherever the host has no such tool — and a
# hook cannot ask: its stdin carries only THIS call's {session_id, tool_name, tool_input},
# with no way to enumerate the session's tools. Worse, no two agent CLIs agree on the name
# or the granularity (TaskCreate one-per-call, Codex `update_plan` whole-list, Gemini
# `write_todos`, Cursor `updateTodos`, Amp `todo_write`), so a name-keyed guard cannot
# generalize even in principle.
#
# So key on CONTENT, not tool identity: a plain checklist file. Write/Edit is provably
# available on every host where this guard can fire — it is what the guard gates — so the
# requirement is now satisfiable exactly where it is enforced. Same move as EditorConfig
# (drop each editor's settings API for one plain file) and Kubernetes preferring httpGet
# over exec probes (drop the in-container binary for a universal contract). The tool-call
# `mark` path below is kept as an OPTIONAL additional satisfier, not the contract.

# Per-phase re-arm: a close-gate run is PLC's phase-close boundary. Detect it

# never reset). Wipe markers -> the next gated edit re-forces a fresh list.
# Must run even when SEEN exists — that's the whole point.
#
# This used to word-split the Bash command and re-arm on a bare `close-gate.sh` /
# `task-done` / `phase-done` TOKEN. That is a syntactic fact standing in for a semantic event,
# and it fired on commands that only READ or STAGED the gate file — `wc -l scripts/…`,
# `git add scripts/…`.
# The token scan is DELETED, not narrowed: no narrowing of "the name appears in
# a string" ever becomes "the thing ran".
#
# The gate now writes its own marker on exit (see scripts/close-gate.sh §"the gate publishes its
# own completion signal"), carrying a per-run id and the exit code. Two consequences worth
# stating rather than discovering:
#
#   * A FAILING gate no longer re-arms. The old check fired in PreToolUse — i.e. when the gate
#     command was ABOUT TO run — so a gate that then failed re-armed exactly as a passing one
#     did. It declared the event before it happened. Re-arm is now conditional on `exit=0`.
#   * The scope changed from per-session to per-repo-per-run. The gate is a separate process and
#     never sees a session_id, so the marker cannot be session-scoped. Re-arm now means "this
#     repo closed a phase since I last looked", not "this session did". The per-run id is what
#     keeps one gate run from re-arming more than once, and what stops last phase's marker from
#     counting — the same anti-stale reasoning as the nonce above, and equally not an mtime.

# THE THIRD STATE. Previously this line was a bare `exit 0`: after one block the guard
# went silent and permitted everything, so every later gated call was indistinguishable in the
# transcript from a genuine pass. That is the defect — not weak enforcement, but DISHONEST

# `skip` vs `xfail`, JUnit `skipped` vs a passing testcase, SARIF `result.kind: notApplicable`
# with `level` forced to `none`. None of them fold it into pass. Neither do we: the call is
# still allowed (block-once, never a wall — a hard wall on a possibly-unsatisfiable demand is
# a deadlock, not rigor), but it is allowed OUT LOUD, on every call, until the list exists.
#
# FIELD CHOICE IS LOAD-BEARING — verified against the documented PreToolUse contract, after
# a first version of this block shipped the wrong two and had to be hotfixed:
#   permissionDecision "allow"  -> "Tool call proceeds WITHOUT permission prompt". That is an
#       auto-approval: it removes the human's confirmation for every gated Edit/Write/commit/
#       push for the rest of the phase. A guard must never buy its own visibility by spending
#       the user's consent. NOT "allow".
#   permissionDecision "defer"  -> "Skips this hook's decision; normal permission flow
#       applies". Exactly the semantics wanted: non-blocking, and the guard abstains rather
#       than deciding.
#   permissionDecisionReason    -> documented as shown to Claude, and explicitly NOT shown anywhere under `allow`;
#       under `defer` the docs are silent, i.e. unspecified.
#       Under defer/allow it is unspecified — i.e. the message reaches nobody. NOT this field.
