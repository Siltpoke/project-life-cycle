"""Tests for scripts/validate.py's input surface.

Check 9 ("all .md are valid UTF-8") used to walk the filesystem with
``REPO.rglob("*.md")``. In a working copy that can reach orders of magnitude more files than are
tracked — the remainder being a co-located tool's cache directory,
the ``docs/`` tree (untracked when this was written; tracked since p39), and other
dot-directories. Two consequences:

1. The validator's verdict depended on unrelated local state it never intended
   to own.
2. ``close-gate.sh``'s test-evidence freshness row cannot be honest. Freshness is
   answerable from git (did a relevant path change since the recorded SHA?), and
   git can only ever see the tracked subset — so a validator with
   nearly all of its inputs invisible to git has no checkable freshness at all.

Narrowing the surface to tracked files is what makes the gate's freshness claim
exactly true rather than approximately true. These tests pin that surface.
