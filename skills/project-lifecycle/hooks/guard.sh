# project-lifecycle — PreToolUse:Bash guard.
# Enforces two rules the skill states in prose (SKILL.md "Commits & branching"):
# never the no-verify bypass flag, never push directly to main. Travels WITH the
# skill (frontmatter hook), complementing the per-project git pre-push hook.
#
# WHAT THIS IS, EXACTLY. This is a best-effort pattern match over a command
# STRING, and that is all it can ever be. Lexical analysis of a shell command line
# cannot decide what the command will do -- config, aliases, substitution and
# quoting all move the answer outside the text. The layers that actually ENFORCE
# are the git pre-push hook and the forge's branch protection, both of which see
# the resolved ref rather than the typed command. This hook is a speed bump in
# front of those, and its messages say so. Claiming otherwise was the defect this
# hook exists to fix: it reported the event it inferred, not the one it checked.
#
# DEPENDENCY ENVELOPE: jq + POSIX sh, no python3. These hooks install with the
# plugin (SKILL.md frontmatter, ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} paths) and run on the
# adopter's machine, so they sit inside the same envelope as close-gate.sh.
# This file used python3 `shlex` from the repo's first
# commit, i.e. it never satisfied the rule that names it -- fixed here.
#
# Exit 2 blocks the tool call; exit 0 allows. Fails OPEN on anything unparseable:
# a weird-but-legitimate command is never wrongly blocked, and the pre-push hook
# remains the backstop. NOT an un-bypassable one, which this comment used to
# claim: `git push --no-verify` skips every pre-push hook, and this file's own
# header names the enforcing layers as the pre-push hook AND the forge's branch
# protection -- only the latter cannot be skipped from a local machine. Calling
# the backstop un-bypassable while failing open in front of it is the same
# inferred-vs-checked defect named above, one level up.

# --- step 1: drop quoted spans -------------------------------------------------
# Everything inside '...' or "..." is DATA, not command structure: a commit
# message may legitimately contain --no-verify, the word main, or an && . POSIX
# word-splitting is not quote-aware (unlike the shlex this replaces), so the
# quoted spans are removed BEFORE anything is tokenized. Removing rather than
# unquoting is deliberate -- it fails toward allowing, which is the correct
# direction for a guard that is explicitly not a boundary.
# KNOWN RESIDUAL: escaped quotes (\") and nested quoting are not modelled. A
# command that defeats this is a command that also defeats reading it.

# --- step 2: split into segments ------------------------------------------------
# `git push origin feat/x && gh pr create --base main` is TWO commands. The old
# check scanned the whole line as one flat token list, so `push` from the first
# and `main` from the second combined into a verdict about neither -- it blocked
# `gh pr create --base main` and branch-delete pushes.
# Splitting on the operator CHARACTERS (not on tokens) also handles the unspaced
# form `x&&gh`, which a token-level split silently misses.
# `$(...)` contents stay in their enclosing segment: that over-blocks rather than
# under-blocks, which is the safe direction.

# KNOWN FALSE POSITIVE -- heredoc and other inline document bodies. The hook
# receives the whole command string, so a `git commit -F - <<EOF ... EOF` whose
# BODY describes a push to main is read as a segment that performs one -- a commit
# message that merely mentions such a push is blocked.
# NOT FIXED HERE, on purpose. The direction is over-block, which is the safe one
# for a guard that is explicitly not a boundary; the workaround is exact and
# already the project's convention for anything long (`git commit -F <file>`,
# `gh pr create --body-file <file>`); and modelling heredocs means matching
# delimiters, `<<-`, and quoted vs unquoted forms -- new machinery for a case a
# file redirect already solves. Recorded and pinned in test-hooks.sh rather than
# left for the next person to rediscover.
#
# KNOWN FALSE NEGATIVES -- stated rather than silently carried. Each of these
# really does push main while containing no `main` token, so no amount of reading
# the command string finds them:
#   * bare `git push` while standing on main (push.default=simple|current), or
#     from any branch under push.default=matching, or via an upstream set by an
#     earlier, unrelated command (push.default=upstream)
#   * a remote.<name>.push refspec configured in git config
#   * git push --all / --mirror
#   * an alias (`git config alias.p push`, then `git p`) -- the word `push` is
#     not in the command at all
# Closing these by READING LIVE GIT CONFIG (push.default, current branch,
# remote.*.push) was considered and DELIBERATELY REJECTED: it would
# reimplement git's own ref-resolution rules inside a best-effort guard, and a
# reimplementation that drifts is exactly the infer-instead-of-check defect this
# file was rewritten to remove -- one layer deeper, and harder to see. The
# pre-push hook and branch protection resolve the real ref; that is their job.
