"""Self-mutation tests for scripts/verify-gate.sh — the jq per-PR artifact validator.

python here is TEST tooling (subprocess-drives the bash gate against fixture git repos),
NOT the gate's runtime envelope — the gate itself stays jq-only.
Each case builds its own fixture git repo.

Invariant for should-block tests: bind report.prHeadSha to the head you pass (via
_perturb_commit) so exactly the target check fires, and assert a check-UNIQUE message
substring — never `returncode != 0` alone (it can pass for the wrong reason, e.g. an
incidental SHA mismatch masking the check actually under test). The sole exception is
test_wrong_sha_report_blocks, which isolates the SHA check on purpose.

# that reaches for python3/node/npx fails this test instead of silently widening the gate's
# dependency footprint. Only WHOLE-LINE comments (`^\s*#`) are dropped before scanning — the
# gate's own prose about staying jq-only (e.g. its header) legitimately mentions these tokens
# without using them, and a naive substring scan on raw source would false-positive on that
# prose. Trailing/inline `#...` is deliberately left in place: stripping from any space-preceded
# `#` (an earlier version of this test did that) is quote-unaware and would swallow real code
# after a `#` that appears inside a string literal earlier on the same line — e.g.
# `echo "use # to skip" && python3 evil.py` would have `&& python3 evil.py` erased along with
# the string's `#`, producing a false negative on an actual violation. Whole-line-only stripping
# closes that gap while still passing the gate's real whole-line comments and leaving bash's
# `${REF#file://}` parameter expansion (never at start of line) untouched.
